# Introduction to APX

APX is a versatile command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to simplify the management of operating system containers. With a focus on efficiency and user-friendliness, APX empowers users to create, manage, and customize containers for a variety of applications and services.

Key features of APX include:

- **Subsystems**: APX supports the management of container-based operating systems running on top of the host.  These are called subsystems in APX.  They are lightweight and provide flexible environments that have no effect on the host system.

- **Stacks**: Organize related configurations and dependencies into cohesive groups called stacks. This feature creates consistent, reproducable environments to develop software, deploy workloads, or install packages that may be incompatible with your host system.

- **Package Manager Integration**: APX includes built-in support for various package managers, enabling users to manage software installations and dependencies directly within their container environments. Users can easily create, update, and remove package managers, streamlining the setup process for their applications.

- **Configuration Management**: APX offers robust tools for creating, updating, importing, and exporting configurations. This capability ensures that users can maintain their setups effectively and share them across different environments or automation tools.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: With intuitive commands and clear feedback, APX is designed for ease of use, making it accessible to both novice and experienced users.

By integrating these powerful features, APX provides developers and system administrators with the tools they need to efficiently manage their containerized applications and associated dependencies. Whether you're deploying microservices or managing development environments, APX helps you streamline your container management process.
