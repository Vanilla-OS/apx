## Docs

The official **documentation and manpage** for `apx` are available at <https://documentation.vanillaos.org/docs/apx/>.

## Dependencies

To add new dependencies, use `go get` as usual, then run `go mod tidy` and finally `go mod vendor` before
committing code.

## Testing Translations locally

To test translations made in the `.yml` file locally, perform `go build` first in the correct directory then execute this command `LANG=<language_code> ./apx man > man/<language_code>/apx.1` (i.e `LANG=sv ./apx man > man/sv/apx.1`).

## Instructions for using Apx in other distributions

Apx has been designed in a distro-agnostic manner, allowing it to work with any distribution. (Note: The Nix integration in Apx requires SystemD)

### Prerequisites

- You must have `go` installed from your distribution's native repositories to compile `apx`.
- You must have `git` installed to clone the repository.
- You must have either `podman` or `docker` installed.
- You must have `make` installed for the installation.

### Procedure

- Clone apx's repository using `git` and enter it using `cd`:-

``` bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/apx.git
cd apx
```

- Use `make build` to build apx:-

``` bash
make build
```

- Install apx using `make`:-

``` bash
sudo make install
```

- Install the apx manpages:-

``` bash
sudo make install-manpages
```

The prefix or installation destination can be changed using `PREFIX` and `DESTDIR` respectively:

To install apx into `~/.local` for example:
``` bash
make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local
make install-manpages PREFIX=$HOME/.local
```
or into a seperate root:
``` bash
make install DESTDIR=$HOME/altroot
make install-manpages DESTDIR=$HOME/altroot
```
