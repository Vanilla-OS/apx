### Generating man pages for translations

Once the translation is complete in Weblate and the changes committed, clone the repository using `git` and perform `go build`, create a directory using the `mkdir man/<language_code> && mkdir man/<language_code>/man1` command, and execute this command `LANG=<language_code> ./apx man > man/<language_code>/man1/apx.1`. Open a PR for the generated manpage here.

## Instructions for using Apx in other distributions

Apx has been designed as a distro-agnostic tool, allowing it to work with any distribution.

### Prerequisites

- You must have `go` installed from your distribution's native repositories to compile `apx`.
- You must have `git` installed to clone the repository.
- You must have either `podman` (suggested) or `docker` installed.
- You must have `make` installed for the installation.

### Procedure

Clone apx's repository using `git` and enter it using `cd`:-

``` bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/apx.git
cd apx
```

Build apx using `make`:-

``` bash
make build
```

Install apx using `make`:-

``` bash
sudo make install
```

Install the apx manpages using `make`:-

``` bash
sudo make install-manpages
```

Uninstall apx using `make`:-

```bash
make uninstall
```

Uninstall apx man pages using `make`:-

```bash
make uninstall-manpages
```

### Installing apx in a custom destination

The prefix or installation destination can be changed using `PREFIX` and `DESTDIR`.

To install apx into `~/.local` for example:-

``` bash
make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local
make install-manpages PREFIX=$HOME/.local
```

Or into a separate root:-

``` bash
make install DESTDIR=$HOME/altroot
make install-manpages DESTDIR=$HOME/altroot
```
