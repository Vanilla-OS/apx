## Documentation and Guides

- The official **documentation and manpage** for `apx` are available at <https://documentation.vanillaos.org/docs/apx/>.

- A guide for Installing applications in `apx` is available at <https://handbook.vanillaos.org/2023/01/11/install-and-manage-applications.html>.

## Dependencies

To add new dependencies, use `go get` as usual, then run `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor` before committing the code.

## Translations

- Contribute translations for the manpage and help page in [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/vanilla-os/apx).

[![Translation Status][weblate-status-image]][weblate-url]

### Generating man pages for translations

- Once the translation is complete in Weblate and the changes committed, clone the repository using `git` and perform `go build`, create a directory using the `mkdir man/<language_code> && mkdir man/<language_code>/man1` command, and execute this command `LANG=<language_code> ./apx man > man/<language_code>/man1/apx.1`. Open a PR for the generated manpage here.

## Instructions for using Apx in other distributions

Apx has been designed as a distro-agnostic tool, allowing it to work with any distribution. (Note: The Nix integration in Apx requires SystemD)

### Prerequisites

- You must have `go` installed from your distribution's native repositories to compile `apx`.
- You must have `git` installed to clone the repository.
- You must have either `podman` or `docker` installed.
- You must have `make` installed for the installation.

### Procedure

- Clone apx's repository using `git` and enter it using `cd`:-

``` bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/apx.git
cd apx
```

- Build apx using `make`:-

``` bash
make build
```

- Install apx using `make`:-

``` bash
sudo make install
```

- Install the apx manpages using `make`:-

``` bash
sudo make install-manpages
```

The prefix or installation destination can be changed using `PREFIX` and `DESTDIR`.

To install apx into `~/.local` for example:-

``` bash
make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local
make install-manpages PREFIX=$HOME/.local
```

Or into a separate root:-

``` bash
make install DESTDIR=$HOME/altroot
make install-manpages DESTDIR=$HOME/altroot
```

## Community Packages

Apx is packaged in various sources by our community, if you aren't comfortable with building `apx` manually you can install a package listed below.

(**Note:** These packages are unofficial if there are any issues with packaging report them to the respective maintainers, if there are any issues with apx functionalities report them here.)
