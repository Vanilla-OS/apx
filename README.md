## Docs

The official **documentation and manpage** for `apx` are available at <https://documentation.vanillaos.org/docs/apx/>.


## Other distros

> Please consider to keep the project name as `apx` to avoid confusion for users.

To use with another package manager, re-compile editing the `config.json` file
to point to the desired package manger and image.


## Dependencies

To add new dependencies, use `go get` as usual, then run `go mod tidy` and finally `go mod vendor` before
committing code.

## Testing Translations locally

To test translations made in the `.yml` file locally, perform `go build` first in the correct directory then execute this command `LANG=<language_code> ./apx man > man/<language_code>/apx.1` (i.e `LANG=sv ./apx man > man/sv/apx.1`).
